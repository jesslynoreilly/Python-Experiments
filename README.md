# Python-Experiments
This repository contains the initial code I created when learning to use GitHub as part of DSCI 8133, *Foundations of Data Science* at Mississippi State university.

## Plan
Future plans for this repository include adding a sample data file and [Juptyer](https://jupyter.org/) notebook that will interact with the file.
